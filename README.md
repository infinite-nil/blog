# Blog

This is my attempt to create a blog system using Rust.

### Goals

- Have fun;
- Build from scratch, even the HTTP server;
- Less dependencies as possible;

### Non-goals for now

- Support other HTTP methods than GET;

### Roadmap

- [x] Create a simple single thread HTTP server;
- [x] handle GET requests;
- [x] handle favicon.ico;
- [x] handle 404;
